.SH TOOLS
.IP COMPILERS
.RS 2
.IP "C" 4
This is the core interface that is always present.
C programs can be compiled/linked using oshcc(1).
.IP "C++" 4
If this interface has been enabled, C++ programs can be
compiled/linked using oshcxx(1).
.RE
.IP LAUNCHER
.RS 2
In this implementation, OpenSHMEM programs can be launched via
oshrun(1).  Job scheduling systems, such as PBS/Torque, SLURM, and
LSF, may provide compatible launchers as well (e.g. srun in SLURM,
aprun in ALPS).

.IP INFORMATION
.RS 2
.IP osh_info 2
A utility that describes configuration settings of this
implementation, osh_info(1).
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP "pkg-config osss-ucx"
If configured in the user's environment, this implementation can be
queried by pkg-config(1).
